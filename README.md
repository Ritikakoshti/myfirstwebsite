                <h6>Chapter 1: Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of </h6>
                Two armies, those of the Pandavas and the Kauravas, face each other on the Battlefield of Kurukshetra.
                Many signs indicate victory for the Pandavas. Dhrtarashtra, the Pandavas’ uncle and the Kauravas’
                father, doubts the possibility of his sons’ victory and asks Sanjaya, his secretary, to describe the
                scene on the battlefield.

                Arjuna, one of five Pandava brothers, undergoes a crisis just before the fight. He is overwhelmed by
                compassion for his family members and teachers, whom he is supposed to kill. After submitting before
                Krishna many noble and moral reasons why he wishes not to fight, Arjuna casts aside his weapons,
                overwhelmed with grief. Arjuna’s reluctance to fight indicates his kind heart; such a person is fit to
                receive transcendental knowledge.

                <h6>Chapter 2: Contents of the Gita Summarized</h6>
                Krishna does not sympathize with Arjuna’s arguments. Rather, He reminds Arjuna that his duty is to fight
                and orders him to overcome his weakness of heart. Arjuna is torn between his aversion to killing his
                relatives and Krishna’s desire that he should fight. Aggrieved and confused, Arjuna asks Krishna for
                guidance and becomes his disciple.

                Krishna takes up the role of Arjuna’s Spiritual Master and teaches him that the soul is eternal and
                cannot be killed. Dying in battle promotes a fighter to the heavenly planets, so Arjuna should rejoice
                that those persons he is about to kill will achieve superior births. A person is eternally an
                individual. Only his body perishes. Thus, there is nothing to lament.

                Arjuna’s decision not to fight is based on his desire to enjoy life with his relatives, even at the cost
                of wisdom and duty. Such a mentality keeps one bound to the material world. Krishna advises Arjuna to
                engage in buddhi-yoga, work without attachment to the results. By fighting in this way, Arjuna will free
                himself from the cycle of birth and death and become eligible to enter the kingdom of God.

                <h6>Chapter 3: Karma – Yoga</h6>
                Arjuna is still confused. He thinks that buddhi-yoga means that one should retire from active life and
                practice penance and austerities. But Krishna says, “no. Fight! But do it in a spirit of renunciation
                and offer all the results to the Supreme. This is the best purification. By working without attachment,
                one attains the Supreme.”

                Performing sacrifices for the pleasure of the Lord guarantees material prosperity and freedom from
                sinful reactions. Even a self-realized person never gives up his duty. He acts for the sake of educating
                others.

                Arjuna then asks the Lord what it is that causes one to engage in sinful acts. Krishna answers that it
                is lust which induces one to sin. This lust bewilders one and entangles one in the material world. Lust
                presents itself in the senses, mind, and intelligence, but it can be counteracted by self – control.

                <h6>Chapter 4: Transcendental Knowledge</h6>
                The science of Bhagavad – gita was first spoken by Krishna to Vivasvan, the sun-god. Vivasvan taught the
                science to his descendents, who taught it to humanity. This system of transmitting knowledge is called
                disciplic succession.

                Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religion and a rise of irreligion, Krishna appears in His
                Original Transcendental Form, untouched by material nature. One who understands the transcendental
                nature of the Lord attains the Lord’s eternal abode at the time of death.

                Everyone surrenders to Krishna, directly or indirectly, and Krishna reciprocates according to one’s
                surrender.

                Krishna created a system called varnasrama, with divisions of social and spiritual life, to engage
                people according to their psychophysical natures. By sacrificing the results of work to the Supreme,
                people gradually rise to the platform of transcendental knowledge. Ignorant and faithless people who
                doubt the revealed knowledge of the scriptures can never be happy, nor attain God Consciousness.


                <h6>Chapter 5: Karma – yoga – Action in Krishna Consciousness</h6>
                Arjuna is still confused about what is better: renunciation of work or work in devotion. Krishna
                explains that devotional service is better. Since everything belongs to Krishna, nothing is one’s own to
                renounce. Thus whatever one possesses one should use in Krishna’s service. A person working in such
                consciousness is renounced. This process, called karma yoga, helps one escape the result of fruitive
                action—entanglement in rebirth.

                One, who works in devotion with his mind and senses controlled, is in divine consciousness. Although his
                senses are engaged with sense objects, he is aloof, situated in peace and happiness.

                <h6>Chapter 6: Dhyana – yoga</h6>
                The process of mystic yoga entails cessation of material activities. Yet the true mystic is not he who
                performs no duty. A real yogi works according to duty, without attachment to results or a desire for
                sense gratification. Real yoga entails meeting the Supreme Soul within the heart and following His
                dictation. This is achieved with the help of a controlled mind. Through knowledge and realization, one
                becomes unaffected by the dualities of material existence (heat and cold, honor and dishonor, etc.). By
                regulation of eating, sleeping, work, and recreation, the yogi gains control over his body, mind and
                activities and becomes steady in his meditation on the transcendent self. Ultimately, he achieves
                Samadhi, characterized by the ability to relish transcendental pleasure through transcendental sense.
                The highest yogi is he who always thinks of Krishna, the Supreme Soul

                <h6> Chapter 7: Knowledge of the Absolute</h6>
                Krishna reveals Himself as the origin of all material and spiritual energies. Although His energy
                manifests material nature, with three states of being (goodness, passion, and ignorance), Krishna is not
                under material control. But everyone else is, except those who have surrendered unto Him.

                Krishna is the essence of everything; the taste of water, the heat in fire, the sound in ether, the
                light of the sun and the moon, the ability in man, the original fragrance of the earth, the intelligence
                of the intelligent, and the life of all that lives.

                Four types of men surrender to Krishna, and four types don’t. Those who do not surrender remain covered
                by Krishna’s temporary, illusory potency and can never know Him, but pious people become eligible for
                surrender to devotional service. Among them, those who understand that Krishna is the cause of all
                causes engage in devotional service with great determination and become dear to Krishna. These rare
                souls are sure to attain Him.

                <h6>Chapter 8: Attaining the Supreme</h6>
                Arjuna asks Krishna seven questions: What is Brahman? What is self? What are fruitive activities? What
                is material manifestation? Who are demigods? Who is the Lord of sacrifice? And how can those engaged in
                devotional service know Krishna at the time of death?

                Krishna replies “brahman” refers to the indestructible living entity (jiva): the “self” refers to the
                soul’s intrinsic nature of service; and “fruitive activities” means actions that develop material
                bodies. The material manifestation is the ever -changing physical nature; the demigods and their planets
                are part of the universal form of the Supreme Lord; and the Lord of sacrifice is Krishna Himself as the
                Super soul.

                As for knowing Krishna at the time of death, it depends on one’s consciousness. The principle is this:
                “Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.”

                Krishna says, “whoever, at the end of life, quits his body remembering Me alone at once attains My
                nature without a doubt. Therefore, My dear Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of Krishna
                and at the same time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting. With your activities dedicated to Me
                and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you will attain Me without doubt.”

                During each day of Brahma, all living entities become manifest, and during his night they merge into the
                unmanifested nature. Although there are auspicious and inauspicious times for leaving one’s body,
                devotees of Krishna do not care about them, for by engaging in pure devotional service to Krishna they
                automatically attain all the results derived from studying the Vedas or engaging in sacrifice, charity,
                philosophical speculation, and so on. Such pure devotees reach the Lord’s Supreme Eternal Abode.

                <h6>Chapter 9: The Most Confidential Knowledge</h6>
                According to Lord Krishna, the most confidential knowledge, knowledge of devotional service, is the
                purest knowledge and the topmost education. It gives direct perception of the self by realization, and
                it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting and joyfully performed.

                Krishna’s unmanifested form pervades everything, but Krishna Himself remains detached from matter.
                Material nature, working under His direction, produces all moving and non-moving beings.

                Krishna’s unmanifested form pervades everything, but Krishna Himself remains detached from matter.
                Material nature, working under His direction, produces all moving and non-moving beings.

                Different worshipers reach different goals. Men who want to attain the heavenly planets worship the
                demigods and then take birth among them to enjoy godly delights; but such men, after exhausting their
                pious credits, return to earth. Men, who worship ancestors, go to the planets of the ancestors, and
                those who worship ghosts become ghosts. But one who worships Krishna with exclusive devotion goes to Him
                forever.

                Whatever Krishna’s devotee does, eats, offers, or gives away in charity, he does as an offering unto the
                Lord. Krishna reciprocates by carrying what His devotee lacks and preserving what he has. By taking
                shelter of Krishna, even lowborn people can attain the Supreme destination.

                <h6>Chapter 10: the Opulence of the Absolute</h6>
                Devotees know Krishna as the unborn, the beginning less, the Supreme Lord of all worlds, the creator of
                the patriarchs from whom all living being descend, the origin of everything.

                Intelligence, knowledge, truthfulness, mental and sensory control, fearlessness, non-violence,
                austerity, birth, death, fear, distress, infamy–all qualities, good and bad, are created by Krishna.
                Devotional service helps one develop all good qualities.

                The devotees who lovingly engage in devotional service have full faith in Krishna’s opulences, mystic
                power, and supremacy. The thoughts of such devotees dwell in Krishna. Their lives are devoted to His
                service, and they derive great bliss and satisfaction by enlightening one another and conversing about
                Him.

                Devotees engaged in pure devotional service, even if lacking education or knowledge of the Vedic
                principles, are helped from within by Krishna, who personally destroys the darkness born out of
                ignorance.


                Arjuna has realized Krishna’s position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the ultimate abode and the
                Absolute Truth, the purest, the transcendental and the original person, the unborn, the greatest, the
                origin, and the Lord of all. Now Arjuna wants to know more. Lord Krishna tells more, and then concludes:
                “All opulent, beautiful, and glorious creations spring from but a spark of My splendor.”

                <h6>Chapter 11: The Universal Form</h6>
                To protect innocent people from imposters, Arjuna asks Krishna to prove His divinity by exhibiting His
                universal form – a form that anyone who claims to be God should be prepared to show. Krishna gives
                Arjuna divine vision by which to see the brilliant, glaring, unlimited universal form, which reveals, in
                one place, everything that ever was or now is or will be.

                Arjuna offers obeisances with folded hands and glorifies the Lord. Krishna then reveals that except for
                the five Pandavas, all the soldiers assembled on the battlefield will be killed. Therefore Krishna
                exhorts Arjuna to fight as His instrument and guarantees him victory and a flourishing kingdom.

                Arjuna requests Krishna to withdraw His fearful form and show His original form. The Lord then exhibits
                His four-armed form and at last His original two-armed form. Upon seeing the Lord’s beautiful humanlike
                form, Arjuna becomes pacified. One who is engaged in pure devotional service can see such a form.

                <h6>Chapter 12: Devotional Service</h6>
                “Who is more perfect,” Arjuna asks, “the devotee worshiping and servicing the Lord’s personal form or
                the transcendentalist meditating on the impersonal Brahman?”

                Krishna replies, “the devotee who fixes his mind on My personal form is most perfect.”

                Because devotional service employs the mind and senses, it is the easy, natural way for an embodied soul
                to reach the supreme destination. The impersonal path is unnatural and fraught with difficulties.
                Krishna does not recommend it.

                In the topmost stage of devotional service, one’s consciousness is totally fixed on Krishna. A step
                lower is the practice of regulative devotional service. Lower than that is karma-yoga, renouncing the
                fruits of action. Indirect processes for attaining the Supreme include meditation and cultivating
                knowledge.

                A devotee who is pure, expert, tolerant, self-controlled, equipoised, non-envious, free from false ego,
                friendly to all living entities, and equal to friends and enemies is dear to the Lord.

                <h6>Chapter 13: Nature, the Enjoyer and Consciousness</h6>
                Arjuna wants to know about prakriti (nature), purusa (the enjoyer), ksetra (the field), ksetra-jna (the
                knower of the field), jnana (knowledge), and gnaya (the object of knowledge).

                Krishna explains that the ksetra is the conditioned soul’s field of activity the body. Within it reside
                both the living entity and the Supreme Lord, who are called ksetra-jna, the knowers of the field. Jnana,
                knowledge, means understanding of the body and its knowers. Knowledge involves qualities such as
                humility, nonviolence, tolerance, cleanliness, self-control, absence of false ego, and even – mindedness
                amid pleasant and unpleasant events.

                Jnaya, the object of knowledge, is the Super soul. Prakriti, nature, is the causes of all material
                causes and effects. The two purusas, or enjoyers, are the living entity and the Super soul. A person who
                can see that the individual soul and the Super soul remain unchanged throughout various types of
                material bodies they successfully inhabit and is said to possess the vision of eternity. By
                understanding the difference between the body and the knower of the body, and by understanding the
                process of liberation from material bondage, one reaches the supreme goal.

                <h6>Chapter 14: The Three Modes of Material Nature</h6>
                The total material substance is the source of the three modes of material nature: goodness, passion and
                ignorance. These modes compete in exerting their influence upon the conditioned soul. By observing the
                modes at work, we can understand that they are active, not we, and that we are separate. In this way,
                the influence of material nature gradually diminishes and we attain Krishna’s spiritual nature.

                The mode of goodness illuminates. It frees one from all sinful reactions but conditions one to a sense
                of happiness and knowledge. One who dies in the mode of goodness attains the higher planets.

                A person influenced by the mode of passion is plagued by unlimited desires for boundless material
                enjoyment, especially sex pleasure. To satisfy those desires, he is always forced to engage in hard work
                that binds him to sinful reactions, resulting in misery. A person in the mode of passion is never
                satisfied with the position he has already acquired. After death, he again takes birth on earth among
                persons engaged in fruitive activities.


                The mode of ignorance means delusion. It fosters madness, indolence, laziness, and foolishness. If one
                dies in the mode of ignorance, he has to take birth in the animal kingdom or the hellish worlds.

                A person who transcends the three modes is steady in his behavior, aloof from the temporary material
                body, and equally disposed towards friends and enemies. Such transcendental qualities can be achieved by
                full engagement in devotional service.

                <h6>Chapter 15: The Yoga of the Supreme Person</h6>
                The “tree” of this material world is but a reflection of the real “tree”, the spiritual world. Just as a
                tree’s reflection is situated on water, the material reflection of the spiritual world is situated on
                desire, and no one knows where it begins or ends. This reflected tree is nourished by the three modes of
                material nature. Its leaves are the Vedic hymns, and its twigs are the objects of the senses. One who
                wants to disentangle himself from this tree must cut it down with the weapon of detachment and seek
                shelter of the Supreme Lord.

                Everyone in this world is fallible, but in the spiritual world everyone is infallible. And beyond all
                others is the Supreme Person, Krishna.

                Everyone in this world is fallible, but in the spiritual world everyone is infallible. And beyond all
                others is the Supreme Person, Krishna.

                <h6>Chapter 16: The Divine and Demoniac Natures</h6>
                Two classes of created beings, the divine and the demoniac, are endowed with different qualities. Godly
                men like Arjuna possess the godly qualities: charity, self-control, gentleness, modesty, forgiveness,
                cleanliness, austerity, simplicity, non-violence, truthfulness, tranquility, fearlessness, freedom from
                anger, cultivation of spiritual knowledge, aversion to fault-finding, compassion for all living beings,
                freedom from covetousness, and steady determination.

                Demoniac qualities such as pride, anger, envy, harshness, arrogance, ignorance, Impudence,
                uncleanliness, and improper behavior bind people in a network of illusion that makes them take birth
                again and again in demoniac species of life. Unable to approach Krishna, the demoniac gradually sink
                down to hell.

                Two kinds of action – regulated and unregulated—yield different results. A person who discards
                scriptural injunctions attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destination. People
                regulated by scripture understand what duty is and what is not. They gradually attain the supreme
                destination by performing acts conducive to self–realization.

                <h6>Chapter 17: The Divisions of Faith</h6>
                Arjuna asks. “what mode of nature governs those who do not follow the principles of scripture but
                worship according to their own imagination?”

                In reply, Krishna analyzes the different kinds of faith, food, charity, austerity, sacrifice, and
                penance that mark the different modes of material nature.

                The three words “om tat” sat are symbolic representations of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Om indicates
                the Supreme, tat is used for getting free from material entanglement, and sat indicates that the
                Absolute Truth is the objective of devotional service. Any sacrifice, charity, or penance performed
                without faith in the Supreme is called asat, impermanent.

                <h6> Chapter 18: Conclusion: The Perfection of Renunciation</h6>
                Arjuna asks Krishna about the purpose of tyaga (renunciation) and sannyasa (the renounced order of
                life). Krishna explains these and the five causes of action, the three factors that motivate action, and
                the three constituents of action. He also describes action, understanding, determination, happiness, and
                work according to each of the three modes of material nature.

                One attains perfection by doing one’s own work, not another’s, as prescribed duties are never affected
                by sinful reactions. Thus one should work as a matter of duty, without attachment or expectation of
                result. One should never give up one’s duty.

                The highest platform of self-realization is pure devotional service to Krishna. Accordingly, Krishna
                advises Arjuna to always depend on Him, work under His protection, and be conscious of Him. If Arjuna
                refuses to fight for Krishna, he will still be dragged into warfare as it is his nature as a ksatriya to
                fight. Nonetheless, he is free to decide what he wants to do.

                By Krishna’s grace, Arjuna’s illusion and doubt vanish, and he chooses to fight according to Krishna’s
                directions.

            <p>
                Muhammad first received revelations in 609 CE in a cave on Mount Hira, near Mecca.
                Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad, the proof of his prophethood, and
                the culmination of a series of divine messages revealed by the angel Gabriel from 609–632 CE.
                The key themes of the early Quranic verses included the responsibility of man towards his creator; the
                resurrection of the dead, God’s final judgment followed by vivid descriptions of the tortures in Hell
                and pleasures in Paradise; and the signs of God in all aspects of life. Religious duties included belief
                in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those
                in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth, being chaste, and not killing newborn girls.
                Muhammad’s immediate family were the first to believe he was a prophet, followed by three main groups of
                early converts to Islam: younger brothers and sons of great merchants, people who had fallen out of the
                first rank in their tribe or failed to attain it, and unprotected foreigners.
                Muslims believe the Quran to be both the unaltered and the final revelation of God. Religious concepts
                and practices include the five pillars of Islam, which are obligatory acts of worship, and following
                Islamic law, which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, from banking and welfare to
                the status of women and the environment
                <b>Quran</b>
                Literally meaning “the recitation,” it is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to
                be a revelation from God.

                Five Pillars of Islam
                Five basic acts in Islam, considered mandatory by believers and are the foundation of Muslim life.

            <summary>TORAH</summary>
            <p>
                The Torah is the first part of the Jewish bible. It is the central and most important document of
                Judaism and has been used by Jews through the ages.

                Torah refers to the five books of Moses which are known in Hebrew as Chameesha Choomshey Torah. These
                are: Bresheit (Genesis), Shemot (Exodus), Vayicra (Leviticus), Bamidbar (Numbers), and Devarim
                (Deuteronomy).

                Jews believe that God dictated the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai 50 days after their exodus from
                Egyptian slavery. They believe that the Torah shows how God wants Jews to live. It contains 613
                commandments and Jews refer to the ten best known of these as the ten 10 statements.

                The Torah is written in Hebrew, the oldest of Jewish languages. It is also known as Torat Moshe, the Law
                of Moses. The Torah is the first section or first five books of the Jewish bible. However, Tanach is
                more commonly used to describe the whole of Jewish scriptures. This is an acronym made up from the first
                letter of the words Torah, Nevi im (prophets), and Ketuvim (writings).

                Similarly, the term Torah is sometimes used in a more general sense to incorporate Judaism’s written and
                oral law. This definition encompasses Jewish scripture in its entirety including all authoritative
                Jewish religious teachings throughout history.

                The word Torah has various meanings in English. These include: teaching, instruction and law. For Jews
                the Torah means all of these.

                How is the Torah used?
                The Torah scrolls are taken out from the Ark (Aron ha kodesh) and portions read in the synagogue three
                times each week. On Mondays and Thursdays small sections are read. The main reading is on the morning of
                Shabbat (Sabbath).

                Over the course of the year the whole scroll is read in sequence. This begins from the end of Sukkot
                which is an autumn festival.

                The special portions for the readings are called parshioth and are usually three to five chapters in
                length. The reader has to be very skilled to read from the scroll because the letters are written
                without corresponding vowels. They have to know the portion very well to avoid making mistakes. The
                reading is conducted using an ancient tune and is sung rather than spoken.

                The scrolls are not directly touched when unfurled on the Bimah (raised platform in middle of the
                synagogue). A pointer or Yad (hand) is used instead. This is in the shape of a hand with an outstretched
                finger. The reading or chanting is performed by a person who has been trained in this task. However it
                may be carried out by the rabbi. It is a very great honour for a congregant to be asked to attend at a
                reading during a synagogue service. This is called having an Aliyah which is Hebrew for going up.

                The weekly portion or Sedrah is followed by the recitation of part of another of the Jewish holy
                writings.

                How is a Torah scroll constructed?
                The Torah scrolls are entirely handwritten in Hebrew by a sofer (scribe) on parchment from a kosher
                animal. This is usually a cow. It can take up to 18 months to complete the whole process from the
                complex preparation of the animal skins to the writing of the final words. Great accuracy is needed when
                the sofer writes the scroll. If he makes any mistakes it can make the whole scroll pasul (invalid). The
                completed scroll is known as a Sefer Torah from sefer which is the Hebrew for book.

                A Sefer Torah is so sacred to Jews it is said that if one is accidentally dropped in the synagogue the
                whole congregation must fast for 40 days. When Jewish communities have suffered persecution, great
                efforts would be made to preserve these scrolls. This demonstrates just how symbolically and physically
                important the Torah is to Jews.

                Oral law
                Alongside the written law Jews believe God also told Moses the spoken or oral law. This is known as the
                Torah she b’al pei or literally Torah from the mouth.

                The letter Pei as well as being the Hebrew word for mouth is the 17th letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Pei
                has a numerical value of 80 which Jews believe is the age that Moses was when he led them out from
                slavery in Egypt.

                Although given at the same time this law was to be passed down orally from generation to generation. It
                is the information Jews need to practise fully the commandments in the written law. It was codified in
                the 2nd Century C.E.

            <summary>GURU GRANTH SAHIB</summary>
            <p>
                The Guru Granth Sahib is not just the holy scripture of Sikhism. It is also considered as the living
                Guru. Before Guru Gobind Singh died, he declared that there would be no more human Gurus and that the
                Guru Granth Sahib would be the Eternal Guru.

                Significance of the Guru Granth Sahib
                It contains the words spoken by the Gurus. This is known as Gurbani, which means ‘from the Guru’s
                mouth’.
                It is believed to be the word of God and is therefore infallible.
                It is written in Gurmukhi. This is the script the Punjabi language is written in.
                It is placed in the prayer hall within the gurdwara. Any building that has a copy of the Guru Granth
                Sahib is considered a gurdwara.
                It is considered as the Living Guru, because the Gurmukhi scripture is considered the word of God and
                therefore treated with respect as a human might be.
                Compilation and contents of the Guru Granth Sahib
                Many of Guru Nanak’s hymns and prayers were preserved and complied by Guru Angad and Guru Arjan. This
                collection became known as the Adi Granth.
                The Adi Granth also included writings from Hindu and Muslim writers who believed in the oneness of God.
                Some of these writers were from lower castes, which shows the inclusiveness of Sikhism.
                The Guru Granth Sahib was completed in 1604 and installed in the Golden Temple. This original copy is
                written in many different languages, reflecting its many different authors.
                Every other copy of the Guru Granth Sahib is identical.
                The first shabad of the Guru Granth Sahib is the Mool Mantra. This is the statement of belief for
                Sikhism. It outlines the belief in one God.
                The first line of the Guru Granth Sahib is “Ik Onkar”. This literally means ‘there is only One God’.
                Respect for the Guru Granth Sahib
                As the Guru Granth Sahib is considered to be the Eternal Guru, Sikhs believe it should be treated in the
                same way the human Gurus were treated. This means it must be treated with the utmost respect.

                There are various ways in which respect for the Guru Granth Sahib must be shown:

                Sikhs remove their shoes and wash their hands before entering the gurdwara.
                Sikhs wear head coverings inside the gurdwara in the presence of the Guru Granth Sahib.
                The Guru Granth Sahib is placed on a takht , which is a raised platform. This is under the manji, which
                is a bed for the Guru Granth Sahib to be placed on. Above this there is the palki, which is a domed
                structure that covers the area that holds the Guru Granth Sahib. This is covered by the chanani, which
                is a canopy made from decorated cloth known as the rumalla.
                The sangat sit on the floor in the Darbar Sahib to ensure their heads are not higher than the Guru
                Granth Sahib.
                Sikhs make offerings to the Guru Granth Sahib when they enter the prayer hall.
                Sikhs never turn their backs on the Guru Granth Sahib.
                A granthi is a person appointed to read the Guru Granth Sahib. When the Guru Granth Sahib is being read,
                a chauri, which is a special fan made from yak hair, is waved above it.
                The Guru Granth Sahib is placed in a separate room at night.

            deals with the first Buddhist council which was held shortly after Buddha’s death, dated by the majority
            of recent scholars around 400 BC, under the patronage of king Ajatasatru with the monk Mahakasyapa
            presiding, at Rajgir.

            <b>Vinaya Pitaka</b>
            The subject matter of Vinay Pitaka is the monastic rules for monks and nuns. It can also be called as
            Book of Discipline.
            <br />
            <b>Suttavibhanga:</b> The basic code of Monastic discipline is known as It contains 227 rules for fully
            ordained Monks called bikkhus (Maha vibhanga) and 311 rules for fully ordained nuns called Bikkhunis

                The original Ramayana written by the 4th c. sage Valmiki comprised of seven “kandas” or books. Many
                scholars question the authorship of the certain passages from the first book (Bala Kanda) and question
                the authenticity of the last book (Uttara Kanda) for various reasons.

                Bala Kanda: “The Book of the Youth,” the boyhood and adolescence of Rama;

                Ayodhya Kanda: “The Book of Ayodhya,” the court of Dasaratha and the scenes that set the stage for the
                unfolding of the story, including the exchange between Dasaratha and Kaikeyi and the exile of Rama;

                Aranya Kanda: “The Book of the Forest ,” life in the forest during the fourteen year exile and the
                abduction of Sita by Ravana;

                Kishkindhya Kanda: “The Book of The Empire of Holy Mokeys,” Rama’s residence in Kishkindhya, the quest
                for Sita, and the slaying of Bali;

                Sundara Kanda: “The Book of the Beautiful (Hanuman),” sundara means beautiful, and this portion of the
                book has passages of lyrical beauty; description of the landscapes over which Rama roams, and the
                arrival of Rama and his allies in Lanka;

                Yuddha Kanda: “The Book of War,” the defeat of Ravana, the recovery of Sita, the return to Ayodhya, and
                the coronation of Rama; and

                Uttara Kanda: “The Book Beyond,” the “later section”, detailing Rama’s life in Ayodhya, the banishment
                of Sita, the birth of Lava and Kusa, the reconciliation of Rama and Sita, her death or return to the
                earth, and Rama’s ascent into heaven.

                <bold>Summary</bold>


                Dasharatha was the King of Ayodhya and had three wives and four sons. Rama was the eldest and his mother
                was Kaushalya. Bharata was the son of Dasharatha’s second and favorite wife, Queen Kaikeyi. The other
                two were twins, Lakshmana and Shatrughna whose mother was Sumithra. In the neighboring city the ruler’s
                daughter was named Sita. When it was time for Sita to choose her bridegroom (at a ceremony called a
                swayamvara) princes from all over the land were asked to string a giant bow which no one could lift.
                However, as Rama picked it up, he not only strung the bow, he broke it. Seeing this, Sita indicated that
                she had chosen Rama as her husband by putting a garland around his neck. Their love became a model for
                the entire kingdom as they looked over the kingdom under the watchful eye of his father the king.

                A few years later, King Dasharatha decided it was time to give his throne to his eldest son Rama and
                retire to the forest. Everyone seemed pleased, save Queen Kaikeyi since she wanted her son Bharata to
                rule. Because of an oath Dasharatha had made to her years before, she got the king to agree to banish
                Rama for fourteen years and to crown Bharata, even though the king pleaded with her not to demand such a
                request. The devastated King could not face Rama and it was Queen Kaikeyi who told Rama the King’s
                decree. Rama, always obedient, was content to go into banishment in the forest. Sita and Lakshmana
                accompanied him on his exile.

                One day Rama and Lakshmana wounded a rakshasas (demon) princess who tried to seduce Rama. She returned
                to her brother Ravana, the ten-headed ruler of Lanka. In retaliation, Ravana devised a plan to abduct
                Sita after hearing about her incomparable beauty. He sent one of his demons disguised as a magical
                golden deer to entice Sita. To please her, Rama and Lakshmana went to hunt the deer down. Before they
                did though, they drew a protective circle around Sita and told her that she would be safe for as long as
                she did not step outside the circle. After Rama and Lakshmana left, Ravana appeared as a holy man
                begging alms. The moment Sita stepped outside the circle to give him food, Ravana grabbed her and
                carried her to his kingdom in Lanka.

                Rama then sought the help of a band of monkeys offer to help him find Sita. Hanuman, the general of the
                monkey band can fly since his father is the wind. He flew to Lanka and, finding Sita in the grove,
                comforted her and told her Rama would come to save her soon. Ravana’s men captured Hanuman, and Ravana
                ordered them to wrap Hanuman's tail in cloth and to set it on fire. With his tail burning, Hanuman
                escaped and hopped from house-top to house-top, setting Lanka on fire. He then flew back to Rama to tell
                him where Sita was.

                Rama, Lakshmana and the monkey army built a causeway from the tip of India to Lanka and crossed over to
                Lanka where a cosmic battle ensued. Rama killed several of Ravana’s brothers and eventually confronted
                the ten-headed Ravana. He killed Ravana, freed Sita and after Sita proved here purity, they returned to
                Ayodhya where Bharata returned the crown to him.

                <img class="imge__" src="images.jpeg" />
                The Mahabharata is an epic that comprises one hundred thousand stanzas of verse
                divided into eighteen books, or parvas. It is the largest single literary work in existence.
                Originally composed in the ancient language of Sanskrit sometime between 400 BC and
                400 AD, it is set in a legendary era thought to correspond to the period of Indian culture
                and history in approximately the tenth century BC.
                The original “author” was Vyasa who tried to tell about the Great War between the
                Pandavas and the Kauravas - cousins who claimed to be the rightful rulers of a kingdom.
                The background to get to where the epic starts is very confusing (in medias res). I’ll
                present the background a bit here just to lay the groundwork.
                Background
                King Santanu married a strange woman he found by the river. They had many children
                and she drowned all of them (I told you she was strange). The king stopped her from
                downing the last child (a boy). She then said she was a goddess and that this child was a
                god but had to remain on earth as punishment for stealing a sacred cow in a past life. The
                child was named Devavratha, but to confuse you he is called Bhishma (one of firm vow).
                The goddess went back to wherever it is that goddesses go, and the king continued ruling.
                One day he fell in love with a woman who ran a ferry; her name was Satyavathi. King
                Santanu asked her father if he could marry her, and he said yes, but only if Satyavathi’s
                children inherit, leaving poor Bhishma out in the cold. Bhishma was actually cool with
                this and said he would remain celibate so that he never had children. Thus, King Santanu
                and ferry woman Satyavathi married. They had two boys: one had no children and died
                in battle, and one (Vichitravirya) grew to adulthood and married two women (Ambika
                and Ambalika). But before either of his wives had children, Vichitravirya died and not
                long after that King Santanu also died. Thus, the only surviving member of the royal
                family was Bhishma who had taken a vow of celibacy and refused to break it.
                What Queen Satyavathis had not told anyone that before she was married she had
                actually been born from a fish and had had an encounter with a sage and given birth to a
                son named Vyasa. So even though Vyasa isn’t exactly the heir, he can still kind of
                inherit.
                Everyone agreed that Vyasa should sleep with Vichitravirya’s two wives and their
                children would inherit. Ambika gave birth to a boy named Dhritarashtra. He was a nice
                enough guy and should have became king, but he was born blind. Meanwhile,
                Vichitravirya’s other wife got with Vyasa and she gave birth to a boy named Pandu.
                Dhritarashtra, being blind, realizes he can’t really rule, so he gives his kingdom to his
                brother Pandu.
                Pandu is a pretty nice guy and loves to hunt. One day he is out hunting and he kills a
                deer while it is in the middle of “love play.” Turns out this is no ordinary deer but a god
                who curses Pandu and says essentially that since you interrupted me, I’m going to mess
                with you. The curse states that if you have sex you’ll die. Pandu has no kids at this time,
                but he does have two wives: Kunthi and Madri. He decides that he can’t rule, so he and
                his wives hang out in the woods.
                One day Kunthi (Pandu’s wife #1) calls out for the sun god. He actually appears and she
                is freaked out. He says, don’t call me unless you want me. He essentially ravishes her,
                though it’s presented in the book as somewhat consensual. She gives birth to a boy
                names Karna but sends him down the river in a basket. He is discovered and raised by a
                soldier and his wife. He comes back later as a force to be reckoned with.
                Pandu thinks that maybe things will work for him if he plays the system. He tells Kunthi
                to have relations with some other gods and have children. Kunthi gets with Yama (god
                of death and justice) and she gives birth to Yudhistira. Then she gets with Vayu (god of
                the wind) and has Bhimasena. Finally she does the deed with Indra (chief god) and gives
                birth to Arjuna. Meanwhile, Pandu’s second wife, Madri, entices the gods Aswins and
                has twins Nakua and Sahadeva. They are all boys, they are all awesome and they are
                collectively known as the Pandavas. The epic focuses on these guys.
                Pandu just can’t resist his urges and tries to have sex with his wife Madri. He dies in her
                arms and she flings herself on his funeral pyre. Kunthi (Pandu’s other wife) takes the
                boys to the blind brother of Pandu, Dhritarashtra, so they can be raised to inherit the
                kingdom.
                Meanwhile, Dhritarashtra (Pandu’s blind brother) married the princess Gandharai and
                becomes a blind king (not a desirable leader but a nice enough guy). She blindfolds
                herself in sympathy of his blindness and never sees again. While Pandu was out in the
                woods with his two wives avoiding sex, Dhritarashtra became king, and he and
                Gandharai had 100 sons (I think they are all born from a metal ball that she harbors in her
                womb for years. When the ball “drops” she wacks it with a stick and out pop the boys).
                These sons are not good boys and fight with their cousins all the time. The oldest of
                these children is named Duryodhana and he’s a real baddy. This collection of boys is
                called the Kauravas
                All 105 boys are looked after by Bhishma who is constantly trying to train them and have
                them get along. The epic is essentially an ongoing feud between the Kauravas and the
                Pandavas. If you haven’t figured it out, the Pandavas are the good guys.
                Details of the story
                The evil brothers were envious of their cousin Yudhistira and started scheming to
                dethrone him. Their first attempt to kill the Pandavas was by burning them inside a
                palace. The Pandavas managed to escape, but then the evil brothers once again attempted
                to gain control. One challenged the eldest brother Yudhisthira to a game of dice which
                led Yudhisthira to lose everything, including his and his brothers' wife, Draupadi. He,
                along with his brothers and their wife Draupadi, were exiled from the kingdom. For
                twelve years they had to live in the forest and upon the thirteenth year they were to hide
                in a city in disguise. It was during those thirteen years that the brothers grew to learn
                what it was like to live with the bare minimum and became more knowledgeable. After
                the thirteenth year Duryodhana decided that he would fight against them which led to a
                huge war and the deaths of many. Many died from both sides and after the war, they
                realized that nothing was really gained.
                The most dramatic figure of the entire Mahabharata, however, was Krishna who was the
                supreme personality of Godhead himself, descended to earth in human form to reestablish
                his devotees as care takers of the earth, and who practiced Dharma.
                Krishna was the cousin of both parties, but he was a friend and advisor to the Pandavas,
                became the brother-in-law of Arjuna, and served as Arjuna's mentor and charioteer in the
                Great War. Krishna is portrayed several times as eager to see the war occur, and in many
                ways the Pandavas were his human instruments for fulfilling that end.
                Throughout their lives and the terrible Great War, there were examples of the ethical gaps
                between men which were never resolved. In the aftermath of the war, Yudhishthira alone
                was terribly troubled, but his sense of the war's wrongfulness persisted to the end of the
                text. This was in spite of the fact that everyone else, from his wife to Krishna, told him
                the war was right; even the dying patriarch, Bhishma, lectured him at length on all
                aspects of the Good Law (the Duties and Responsibilities of Kings).
                In the years that followed the Great War, the only survivors on the part of the Kauravas,
                Duryodhana's parents, King Dhritarashtra and his queen, Gandhari lived a life of
                asceticism in a forest retreat and died with yogic calm in a forest fire. Kunti, the mother
                of the Pandavas was with them too. Krishna departed from this earth thirty-six years after
                the Great War. When they learned of this, the Pandavas believed it was time for them to
                leave this world too and they embarked upon the 'Great Journey,' which involved walking
                north toward the polar mountain that is toward the heavenly worlds, until one's body
                dropped dead. One by one, beginning with Draupadi, the Pandavas died along the way
                until Yudhishthira was left alone with a dog that had accompanied him from the start.
                Yudhishthira made it to the gates of heaven and there refused the order to drive the dog
                back, at which point the dog was revealed to be an incarnate form of the God Dharma
                (the God who was Yudhishthira's actual, physical father), who was there to test
                Yudhishthira's virtue. Once in heaven Yudhishthira faced one final test of his virtue: He
                saw only the Dhartarashtra Clan in heaven, and he was told that his brothers were in hell.
                He insisted on joining his brothers in hell, if that were the case! It was then revealed that
                they were really in heaven, that this illusion had been one final test for him.
                In essence, the epic story represents an extended exploration of the responsibilities set
                forth by the code of dharma. In addition to recounting a heroic tale, the Mahabharata
                contains a collection of writings on a broad spectrum of human learning, including ethics,
                law, philosophy, history, geography, genealogy, and religion. It also features a number of
                legends, moral stories, and local tales all woven into an elaborate narrative.
